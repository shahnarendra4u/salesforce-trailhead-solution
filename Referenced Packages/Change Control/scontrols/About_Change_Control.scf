<h2>About ChangeControl&trade; </h2>
<p>
In large development or production environments, it's important to coordinate 
the application of changes to any system.&nbsp; You don't want developers and 
administrators stepping on each other's work, but SFDC doesn't provide any 
structured way of controlling changes.</p>
<p>
This free application provides a simple way to notify team members and manage 
changes to SFDC.&nbsp; Once installed, it provides a new tab with a form for 
requesting changes.&nbsp; Once you've made a request, team members are notified 
and the request is approved or rejected via a pair of SFDC workflows.&nbsp; The 
application includes a dashboard and supporting reports to view the pipeline of 
requested changes.</p><p><b>What it does</b></p>
<p>The Changes tab gives a View of change requests that have been recently made 
or acted on.&nbsp; Click on the New button to create a new change request, 
filling out the fields/text boxes.&nbsp; Save it as 
usual, and you'll notice that there are related lists for Change Objects, 
Notes &amp; Attachments, Change Control History, and Approval History.</p>
<p>Saving the initial request triggers an approval workflow, to individuals that 
you set up.&nbsp; Once the initial request is approved or denied, the request is 
worked on by developers or administrators.</p>
<p>When the requested change is ready for deployment, the 
developers/administrators do <b>not </b>set the Request Status to Completed (in 
fact, they can't).&nbsp; Instead, they push the Approval Request at the bottom 
of the related list page, which -- you guessed it -- triggers a final approval 
workflow.&nbsp; Once the designated approver accepts the change, the Request status is changed to Completed.</p>

<p><b>Installation</b></p>
<fieldset>
<p><br>
This application is provided <b>without charge</b>, and is provided to everyone 
on an as-is basis.&nbsp; Read the licensing terms
<a href="http://www.saleslogistix.com/solutions/ChangeControlLicense.html">here</a> 
-- by using this product, you are agreeing to its terms.&nbsp; If you do not

<p>Download the application as a package and install it.&nbsp; The package 
automatically creates a Custom App, Custom Tab, two Custom Objects, some reports, and a dashboard.&nbsp; There is no 
code involved here.</p>
<p>You'll need to create two Workflows for the initial and complete approval 
cycles, &nbsp; and you may want to modify the page 
layouts for searches.

<h2 class="exchangeTitle">The AppExchange</h2>
<p>The AppExchange is the world's first on-demand application-sharing service. The 
hundreds of pre-built applications and components it offers have been created by salesforce.com customers, developers, and partners. With these apps, users can do everything from managing expenses to tracking purchasing to monitoring recruiting. Companies can browse, test drive, and install these apps into their salesforce.com accounts with a single click.</p>
<p>Using the AppExchange, organizations can easily add new apps to their current salesforce.com deployments, run them alongside their existing on-demand applications, and easily customize them to meet their unique needs. The breadth of applications on the AppExchange including CRM and many other types of business apps is limited only by the imagination of its publishers and the on-demand community itself.</p>
